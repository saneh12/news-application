# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Here’s a sample `README.md` file for your React Vite-based news application:

```markdown
# News Application

A simple news application built using React and Vite, fetching top headlines from the NewsAPI based on selected categories.

## Features

- Fetches the latest news from multiple categories (e.g., General, Business, Sports, etc.).
- Displays headlines with title, description, and images.
- Built using React with Vite for fast development and bundling.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your project up and running locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-application.git
cd news-application
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up API key

To fetch news data, you will need to sign up for an API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). 

Once you have your API key, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your key:

```
VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 4. Start the development server

Now, you can start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can:

- Select a news category (e.g., General, Business, Technology) to view the latest headlines.
- Click on any article to view more details on the news source's page.
- The application will automatically update news articles whenever the selected category changes.

## Project Structure

- `src/` – Contains all the source code for the application.
  - `components/` – React components like `NewsBoard` and `NewsItem`.
  - `assets/` – Static assets such as images and styles.
  - `App.jsx` – The main app component that sets up routing and global state.
- `public/` – Contains the public assets like `index.html` and `favicon.ico`.
- `.env` – Environment variables for storing the API key.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Next-generation front-end tooling for fast development and bundling.
- **NewsAPI**: Provides access to live news articles and headlines from around the world.
